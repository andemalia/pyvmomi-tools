<p>The project consists of classes and methods developed to make <a href="http://vmware.github.io/pyvmomi-community-samples/">community-samples</a> easier to work with. The majority of these tools started life as part of a sample and then were cleaned up, revised, and promoted to a reusable tool. </p>

<a name="work-in-progress" class="anchor" href="#work-in-progress"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Work In Progress</h3>

<p>This project is very much a work in progress. It will be built by your collaboration and ultimately belongs to the Python community that is interested in developing software with VMware APIs.</p>
